medicine= {'''Pepper_bell_Bacterial_spot''':
       '''Medication:- Seed treatment with hot water, soaking seeds for 30 minutes in water pre-heated to 125 F/51 C, is effective in reducing bacterial populations on the surface and inside the seeds. However, seed germination may be affected by heat treatment if not done accurately, while the risk is relatively low with bleach treatment.
   Precaution:- Rotate your vegetable crops each season to prevent buildup in the soil of diseases or insects. Grow disease-resistant pepper varieties. Keep the pepper garden free from debris. Make sure your plants don’t get excessive moisture and soil is well-draining''',
   '''Pepperbell_healthy''':''' 
Medication:-
Control of bacterial spot relies on: (i) growing healthy plants from seed free from infection, and (ii) care in handling seedlings when transplanting them from nursery to field.

   Precaution:- Buy fresh bell peppers and stay away from canned goods. Buy organic if you can.
For young babies, steamed and mashed bell pepper is ideal.
As your baby grows and is having finger foods, you can offer sliced and roasted bell peppers that are cut in age-appropriate sizes.''',
'''Potato_Early_blight''':'''Medication:- Treatment of early blight includes prevention by planting potato varieties that are resistant to the disease; late maturing are more resistant than early maturing varieties. Avoid overhead irrigation and allow for sufficient aeration between plants to allow the foliage to dry as quickly as possible''',
     '''Potato_Late_blight''':'''Medication:- Late blight is controlled by eliminating cull piles and volunteer potatoes, using proper harvesting and storage practices, and applying fungicides when necessary. Air drainage to facilitate the drying of foliage each day is important. Under marginal conditions, overhead sprinkler irrigation can favor late blight; in Tule Lake under solid set sprinklers, conditions conducive to late blight development are enhanced by day time irrigation but not night time irrigation.
   Precaution:- All aspects of potato growing from planting to harvesting and storage can have an impact on late blight. Cultural control methods should be the first line of defense against the disease.''',
   '''TomatoTarget_Spot ''':'''Medication:- Many fungicides are registered to control of target spot on tomatoes. Growers should consult regional disease management guides for recommended products. Products containing chlorothalonil, mancozeb, and copper oxychloride have been shown to provide good control of target spot in research trials
   Precaution:- Cultural Control
Bacterial spot occurs commonly in tomatoes throughout California. Using pathogen-free seed and disease-free transplants, when possible, is the best way to avoid bacterial spot on tomato. Avoiding sprinkler irrigation and cull piles near greenhouse or field operations, and rotating with a nonhost crop also helps control the disease.

Organically Acceptable Methods
Cultural controls and some copper formulations are acceptable for use on organically certified produce.

Monitoring and Treatment Decisions
Copper-containing bactericides provide partial disease control. Apply at first sign of disease and repeat at 10- to 14-day intervals when warm, moist conditions prevail. Copper is strictly a protectant and must be applied before an infection period occurs.''',
    '''Tomato_Bacterial_spot''':'''Medication:- Control of bacterial spot relies on: (i) growing healthy plants from seed free from infection, and (ii) care in handling seedlings when transplanting them from nursery to field.

Cultural control is important, as it is difficult to control this disease with chemicals. Not only are the chemicals expensive, but also they are easily washed off leaves and fruits in heavy rain showers that occur frequently in Pacific island countries.
   Precaution:- Plant pathogen-free seed or transplants to prevent the introduction of bacterial spot pathogens on contaminated seed or seedlings.  If a clean seed source is not available or you suspect that your seed is contaminated, soak seeds in water at 122°F for 25 min. to kill the pathogens.''',
    '''Tomato_Early_blight''':'''Medication:- . Tomatoes that have early blight require immediate attention before the disease takes over the plants. Thoroughly spray the plant (bottoms of leaves also) with Bonide Liquid Copper Fungicide concentrate or Bonide Tomato & Vegetable. Both of these treatments are organic.
   Precaution:-
Maintain plant vigor. Maintaining adequate fertilization and improving host vigor can reduce susceptibility to early blight.
Remove volunteer weeds. ...
Rotate every 2-3 years. ...
Apply fungicides preventatively.
Plant tolerant varieties.''',
   '''Tomato_healthy''':'''Medication:- Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is a commonly eaten fruit that grows on a vine. It contains many nutrients, including an antioxidant called lycopene.

The lycopene in tomato is thought to play a role in preventing cancer. It's easier for the body to use lycopene that comes from tomato products, such as tomato paste or tomato juice, than from fresh tomatoes.

People use tomato for cancer prevention, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, osteoarthritis, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.
   Precaution:-
Remove volunteer weeds,Rotate every 2-3 years.,Apply fungicides preventatively,Plant tolerant varieties.''',
    '''Tomato_Late_blight''':'''Medication:- For the home gardener, fungicides that contain maneb, mancozeb, chlorothanolil, or fixed copper can help protect plants from late tomato blight. Repeated applications are necessary throughout the growing season as the disease can strike at any time.''',
    '''Tomato_Leaf_Mold''':'''Medication:- The pathogen P. fulfa can survive on infected plant debris or in the soil, although the initial source of the disease is often infected seed. The disease is spread by rain and wind, on tools and clothing, and via insect activity. High relative humidity (greater that 85%) combined with high temperatures encourages the spread of the disease. With that in mind, if growing tomatoes in a greenhouse, maintain night temps higher than outside temperatures. When planting, use only certified disease-free seed or treated seed. Remove and destroy all crop debris post-harvest. Sanitize the greenhouse between crop seasons. Use fans and avoid overhead watering to minimize leaf wetness. Also, stake and prune plants to increase ventilation.
   Precaution:-

Avoiding sprinkler irrigation and cull piles near greenhouse or field operations, and rotating with a nonhost crop also helps control the disease.''',
'''Tomato_Septoria_leaf_spot''':'''Medication:- Removing infected leaves. Remove infected leaves immediately, and be sure to wash your hands and pruners thoroughly before working with uninfected plants.
Consider organic fungicide options. Fungicides containing either copper or potassium bicarbonate will help prevent the spreading of the disease. Begin spraying as soon as the first symptoms appear and follow the label directions for continued management.
Consider chemical fungicides. While chemical options are not ideal, they may be the only option for controlling advanced infections. One of the least toxic and most effective is chlorothalonil (sold under the names Fungonil and Daconi
   Precaution:-
:- All aspects of potato growing from planting to harvesting and storage can have an impact on late blight. Cultural control methods should be the first line of defense against the disease.

Choosing the Right Site and Soil Conditions

The area where potatoes are grown should be well aerated so that the leaves and air within the canopy do not retain humidity.

    '''Tomato_Spider_mites_Two_spotted_spider_mite''':'''Medication:- For control, use selective products whenever possible. Selective products which have worked well in the field include:

bifenazate (Acramite): Group UN, a long residual nerve poison
abamectin (Agri-Mek): Group 6, derived from a soil bacterium
spirotetramat (Movento): Group 23, mainly affects immature stages
spiromesifen (Oberon 2SC): Group 23, mainly affects immature stages
OMRI-listed products include:

insecticidal soap (M-Pede)
neem oil (Trilogy)
soybean oil (Golden Pest Spray Oil)
With most miticides (excluding bifenazate), make 2 applications, approximately 5-7 days apart, to help control immature mites that were in the egg stage and protected during the first application. Alternate between products after 2 applications to help prevent or delay resistance.
